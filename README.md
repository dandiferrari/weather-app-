# weather-app-
This repository contains a simple Weather App built with the latest Laravel framework, using Breeze for authentication and Vue.js for a reactive front-end. The app fetches and displays real-time weather data for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API, and it is styled with Tailwind CSS to ensure a clean and responsive user interface.
